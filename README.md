# Philosophy and Breakdown of algortithms.

### I believe a lot of algorithms have semantic differences and differences in framing and putting of those problems. But internally, a lot of them follow some general mathematical rules,properties and strategies. So with this repository , I try to breakdown a given class of algorithm problems into one category, break it down to reach at a very trivial level by philosophically asking what the question actually wants us to do. And then with the help of this generalization I try to reach at the bottom engine of what is going on at the core of the problem. Because I believe once we deeply understand that, a lot of questions are just abstractions over those core problems. Just like car is just engine,gear and tyres, everything else is an abstraction including steering, seats etc. When you want to learn about car, you learn about wheels, gears and engine and not the abstraction. That is kind of what my goal is right now, once I have got the core methodology and engine of the problem in my head. Whether the problem is a hyundai or chevrolet, I can break it down.
