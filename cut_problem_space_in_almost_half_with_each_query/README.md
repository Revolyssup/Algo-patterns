# CORE PHILOSOPHY

## We get closer and closer to an element satisfying a given property(asked directly or though about) as all elements together follow some kind of rule R.
## So we create a query resonating with the rule R. And by controlling jumps and the element we land on. We reduce the problem size each time because landed element follows R with respect to group, some information can be collected for a set of other elements too with respect to which R is being followed, such that those elements can confidently tell you the absence of answer within them and you can shorten your search space. 

## So basically , the cleverness is in first: Designing the query as close as you can to the rule R, and then regulating the jumps which can help us to reduce the problem size maximally.

### So each problem in this directory has three mandatory comments. THE PROPERTY(for the required element) and THE RULE WITHIN and The Strategy.
